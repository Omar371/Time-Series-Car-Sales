ECE9603/9063: Data Analytics Foundations

Abstractâ€”The importance of cars and automobiles evolves continuously as the economy grows and job
opportunities increase. Cars provide more freedom for mobility and significantly decrease travel
times. Therefore, car sales are important as demand increases and these sales are often an indicator
of the economic growth in countries.
The forecasting problem that is discussed in this project aims to forecast the future quantity of cars
sold every month in the country of Norway. Forecasting the future quantities of cars sold every
month helps businesses to manage their resources and adjust their plans for cash flow management,
it also helps governments to analyze changes in the economy. A dataset that contains information
about the number of different car models sold every month for ten years (2007-2017) in Norway
is used to solve this forecasting problem.
